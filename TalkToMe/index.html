                  Everybody knows and I feel left out
                  Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
                  Cause ever since I left the city, you
                  Started wearing less and goin' out more
                  Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
                  Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

                  You make me feel like I did you wrong
                  Going places where you don't belong

                  These days, all I do is
                  Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
                  Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
                  Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else

                  You was in the zone, yeah
                  You should just be yourself

                <li><button class="copy-text" data-text="To be, or not to be, that is the question:
                  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
                  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
                  And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
                  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
                  The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
                  That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
                  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
                  To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
                  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
                  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                  Must give us pause—there's the respect
                  That makes calamity of so long life.
                  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                  Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
                  The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
                  The insolence of office, and the spurns
                  That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
                  When he himself might his quietus make
                  With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
                  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
                  But that the dread of something after death,
                  The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
                  No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
                  And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                  Than fly to others that we know not of?
                  Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,
                  And thus the native hue of resolution
                  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                  And enterprises of great pith and moment
                  With this regard their currents turn awry
                  And lose the name of action.">To be or not to be</button></li>

                  Surfed out outside, white interior, lasagna
                  Hundred thousands I just cashed out on designer
